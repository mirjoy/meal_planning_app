# Delistcious

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/mirjoy/meal_planning_app/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/mirjoy/meal_planning_app)

This is a personal project that was worked on over the course of 3 weeks. The object was to consume an API.

I take a recipe API, ask users for their dietary preferences, and then generate a meal plan which can be exported to Wunderlist or texted to their phone.
